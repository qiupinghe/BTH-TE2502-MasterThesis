# TE2502-MasterThesis

The name of the master thesis is *Performance Evaluation and Comparison of standard Cryptographic Algorithms and Chinese Cryptographic Algorithms*.
The master thesis has compared the performance when replacing standard cryptographic algorithms (ECDSA, RSA, SHA-256, AES-128) with Chinese cryptographic algorithms (SM2, SM3, SM4). 

This repository contains the scripts and programs that were used during the experiment to measure the performance of the algorithms.
